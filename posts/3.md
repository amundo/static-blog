title: Compiling a binary with deno - Stage 3

description: We use the `deno compile` command to create a standalone binary from our static site generator
chapter: 3

Deno has a nifty feature that allows us to compile our scripts into standalone binaries. This is useful for distributing our generator to others who may not have Deno installed.

In this stage, I’ll try to compile the `generate.js` script into a standalone binary for linux using the `deno compile` command, and give it to a friend to try.

I’ll report back with the results.
