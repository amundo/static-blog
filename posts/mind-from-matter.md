I have gotten interested in work by science journalist [Sally Adee](https://www.sally80.com/), in particular her book _We Are Electric_.

She narrated the audiobook, and she’s a fun listen. She is clearly a word nerd and takes a lot of pleaure in tongue-in-cheek or occasionally off-color jabs. 

The book addresses the notion of “bioeclectricity” and how it might be a revolutionary insight into the nature of biology.

I’m looking forward in particular to the chapter on Michael Levin, who is someone I have been curious about for a while.

I do wonder if there’s some hype here. For instance, this skeet:

[A Radical New Proposal For How Mind Emerges From Matter](https://www.noemamag.com/a-radical-new-proposal-for-how-mind-emerges-from-matter/)


“our definition of intelligence is flawed and needs revision. The article ultimately ties this debate to the ecological crisis, emphasizing that recognizing intelligence across species could reshape how humans coexist with and restore the natural world.”
