title: Adding a watch function - Stage 2

description: Improving the development cycle by using file watching in our static site generator

In this stage, we’ll use the `Deno.watchFs` function to monitor changes to our
markdown files and automatically regenerate the HTML output as needed.

## Features

- Watches for changes to markdown files
- Automatically regenerates HTML output
- Improved development cycle

## Note

I think this is way too complicated and is redundant with the `generate.js` itself. But whatever. Let's see how it goes.

## How it works:

The `Deno.watchFs` function allows us to monitor a directory for changes to its
contents. We can use this to watch our `posts` directory and trigger the
generator script whenever a markdown file is added, removed, or modified.

Here’s the `watch()` function we’ll add to our generator script:



<pre data-src="../watch.js"></pre>
